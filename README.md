# HIL (Hardware-In-the-Loop) Simulation
A project dedicated to practicing Rust skills through the development of a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulation. 
## Goals :)
- **Rust Practice:** Deepening understanding of ownership, concurrency, and using I/O.
- **HIL Simulation:** Modeling hardware responses by sending and receiving data over serial interfaces.
- **Documentation:** Learning CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions and hosting technical documentation via GitHub Pages.

##Documentation
The full technical documentation, including module definitions and protocol specifications, is automatically generated and hosted here:
